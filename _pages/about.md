Here is Shunshun Cao, a PhD student at Department of Astronomy, School of Physics, Peking University. I work on observations/theories toward understanding pulsars' emission and magnetospheres. I was born in Dongyang, Zhejiang, in southeast China.

Pulsars
======
Pulsars are rotating compact celestial objects, with strong magnetic field. They are powerful particle accelerators in our universe, thus involve many kinds of particle and plasma physical processes.

Pulsars are usually interpreted as neutron stars, but the question on their equation of state is still unsolved.

Pulsars emit signals from radio to gamma-ray wave bands. Related celestial objects are pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) and pulsar halos.
